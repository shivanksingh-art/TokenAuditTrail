    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="feature-tag">Solidity</span>

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>TokenAuditTrail</strong> is a Solidity smart contract that provides a secure, immutable ledger of token transactions, specifically crafted for compliance auditing.
      Each token transfer is recorded with full details: sender, receiver, amount, timestamp, and transaction hash.<br>
      This level of transparency and immutability helps organizations meet regulatory requirements by providing a verifiable, on-chain audit trail of token activity.

    <h2>Project Vision</h2>
    <p>
      Our vision is to empower blockchain projects, financial institutions, and regulatory bodies with a tamper-proof, accessible token transaction log that amplifies trust, accountability, and compliance.<br>
      <b>TokenAuditTrail</b> aims to become the go-to compliance layer, seamlessly integrating with any token system to streamline reliable audits and reporting.

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="feature-tag">Immutable Logging</span> Every token transfer is logged immutably on-chain, creating a permanent transaction record.</li>
      <li><span class="feature-tag">Detailed Records</span> Each log includes sender, recipient, amount, timestamp, and the transfer's transaction hash for robust auditing.</li>
      <li><span class="feature-tag">Admin Control</span> Only authorized admins can log transfers, protecting data integrity.</li>
      <li><span class="feature-tag">On-chain Access</span> All transfer records are available via public view functions for full transparency.</li>
      <li><span class="feature-tag">Event Emission</span> Contract emits events for off-chain indexing and real-time monitoring by compliance tools.</li>
      <li><span class="feature-tag">Simple Integration</span> Designed to integrate with existing token contracts to log their transfers without disruption.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future Scope</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Multi-admin role support and customizable permissions.</li>
      <li>Native integration with popular token standards (<code>ERC20</code>, <code>ERC721</code>) for seamless automated transfer detection.</li>
      <li>Advanced querying/filtering capabilities for generating audit reports.</li>
      <li>Off-chain compliance dashboards and alerting powered by emitted contract events.</li>
      <li>Support for cross-chain token transfer logging.</li>
      <li>Incorporation of cryptographic proofs for even greater data verification.</li>
    </ul>
